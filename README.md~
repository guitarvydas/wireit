# quickie redrawing of diagram in https://github.com/google/wireit/blob/main/src/watcher.ts
- I'm convinced that there is a semantic error in this quickie, but, the point is to show how to draw a compilable diagram
- (-) use draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net)
- (a) make each box stand-alone (use processes, or closures, or 0D)
- (b) put input and output ports on each box
- (c) join the boxes with arrows
- (d) compile with das2json tool, admire the .json
- (e) run the compiled diagram with 0D (omitted in this quickie example)
